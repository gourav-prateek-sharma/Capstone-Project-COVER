BWiFi: Intelligent Zone Optimization for Mesh Wi-Fi Networks


The Bwifi framework presents a data control approach to identify the optimal Wi-Fi connection zone in a networked network environment. Research supports the increasing need for more intelligent home and office network optimization, especially in configurations with several access points (APs) and extenders. By analyzing real-world signal quality and performance data, Bwifi allows intelligent recommendations to improve the user experience. Data records include metrics such as signal strength (RSSI), package error rate (PER), latency, throughput, sewer usage, and data transmission. This study aims to identify the zones with the best possible connectivity. 

The difference in performance between the main AP and the extender. Clustering Technology Used: Clustering helps group similar zones based on power metrics such as RSSI, Per, Sulput, etc. This unattended learning method is ideal for discovering unique structures without previous names. Medium strong zone. Useful for environments with different interference and layout complexity. Heuristic Analysis Why was used: Completes the formation of cluster formations with domain-specific rules for decision-making, ensuring interpretability and rapid tuning. cluster. 


Advantages: Easy to implement and understand. provides deterministic control over performance recommendations. Improvements are translated directly into smooth streaming, faster downloads, better video calls. This dual approach guarantees adaptability, reliability and practical utility for both researchers and network engineers. Data records and methods also provide valuable benchmarks for future Wi-Fi performance optimization with AI.
